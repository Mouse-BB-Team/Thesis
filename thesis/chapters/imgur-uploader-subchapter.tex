\subsection{Uploading charts on web}\label{subsec:charts-web-uploading}
To see whether the machine learning model is actually getting better during the training process, accuracy and loss charts are really helpful to determine the learning curve.
To receive a "live" preview of the model execution results with charts as a notification in Slack communicator, the charts needed to be hosted somewhere on the internet.
Easiest way to achieve this was to use the API of the Imgur\footnote{\url{https://imgur.com/}} platform.
Thanks to the official module that can be used with Python, the platform is offering a simple way to upload the images to the service and returns the URL to the image when successfully uploaded.
