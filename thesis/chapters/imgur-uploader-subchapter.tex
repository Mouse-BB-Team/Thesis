\subsection{Uploading charts on web}\label{subsec:charts-web-uploading}
To see whether the machine learning model is actually getting better during the training process, accuracy and loss charts can be used as a really helpful method to determine the learning curve.
To receive a "live" preview of the model execution results with charts as a notification in Slack communicator, the charts needed to be stored somewhere on the internet.
The easiest way to achieve this requirement was to use the API of the Imgur\footnote{\url{https://imgur.com/}} platform.
Thanks to the official module that can be used with Python, the platform offers a simple way to upload the images to the service and returns the URL to the stored image when successfully uploaded.
