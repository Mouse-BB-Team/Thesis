\subsection{Results terminating}\label{subsec:results-terminating}
When the model was executing the calculations multiple times, the results for each iteration were collected.
This is giving a really interesting insight into the model and its stability.
The tool called \mbox{\textit{ResultTerminator}} was serving this purpose.
The helper methods were used to determine whether the file is existing already and if not creating it.
To avoid concurrent saving problems, the file is achieving the lock and releasing it when the content is successfully saved to CSV file.
