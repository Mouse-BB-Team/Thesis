\section{Data preprocessing}\label{sec:data-preprocessing}
To fulfill the requirements of the adapted transfer learning model the preprocessing tool was developed alongside a whole bunch of settings.
The collected data sequences are in form of coordinates' series, so it is necessary to represent them as 3-dimensional pictures which are the input to the convolutional neural network.
The described tool allows transferring those sequences into multidimensional arrays of integers and also scale them to the required input size of a used transfer learning model.

Moreover, to improve performance efficiency the isolated points on the "painting" are interpolated using a linear interpolation mechanism.
It was verified on the collected dataset that interpolated data results in better accuracy of a model in comparison to the isolated ones.
The presented tool works also as a splitter between training and testing sets using the provided ratio between them and as a label assigner which allows adding the corresponding labels to the single sequence basing on the provided identifier of the bot user.

Using this tool it is also possible to increase the number of bot samples by using several repetitions of the original bot set in cases of an imbalanced dataset.
The output of the preprocessor is a tuple of training and testing dataset along with labels, which can be directly the input of a neural network model.
