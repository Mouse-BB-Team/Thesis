\section{Bézier curves}\label{sec:bezier-curves}
To achieve a smooth, parametric curve, widely used in computer graphics, animation and font creation, the Bézier curves are used.
They are named after the Pierre Etienne Bézier (1910-1999) --- French engineer and mathematician with merits in the field of mechanical engineering.

The Bézier curves are based on the \textit{Berenstein polynominal basis}, that was "introduced 100 years ago as a means to constructively prove the ability of polynomials to approximate any continuous function, to any desired accuracy, over a prescribed interval~\cite{farouki2012bernstein}.
If so, some of the properties for the Bézier curves are derived immediately, for example it is known that the basis functions are real, the curve generally follows the shape of the control polygon, the first and last points on the curve are coincident with the first and last points of the control polygon, and so on~\cite{bezier-curves}.
