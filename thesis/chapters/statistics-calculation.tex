\paragraph{Statistics calculation}\label{para:statistics-calculation}
The prepared model was intended to be running several times in order to measure the consistency and stability of the results.
To properly measure and visualize the model scores, a dedicated module for processing the results was prepared.
Two main core parts can be distinguished --- the plotting utilities and the statistics metrics calculation submodule.

The submodule for calculating a metrics allows for producing the mean value of accuracy, model losss, percentage of FAR and FRR, number of true negatives, true positives, false negatives and false positives.
The plotting submodule allows for producing the following charts:
\begin{samepage}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[---] Generic linear plot creation used to display accuracy and loss charts
        \item[---] Creating the accuracy percentile histogram
    \end{itemize}
\end{samepage}

The above metrics and functionalities are designed to produce the averaged model results for multiple executions.
The developed model is stable and the error is irrelevant between each execution.
