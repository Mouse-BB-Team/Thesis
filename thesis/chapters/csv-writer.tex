\subsection{CSV writer}\label{subsec:csv-writer}
To persist machine learning model execution results and statistics for later analysis, it had to be stored somewhere.
The CSV\footnote{Comma-Separated Values} file is a convenient file format to persist this kind of data because all the values could be from the different execution sessions that could be saved in a column.
The CSVWriter class introduces methods for appending the data to the file. The other helper methods allow for checking the correctness of the file and its content.
