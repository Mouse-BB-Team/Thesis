\subsection{CSV writer}\label{subsec:csv-writer}
To persist machine learning model execution results and statistics for later analysis, the outcome data should be stored in a consistent way.
The CSV\footnote{Comma-Separated Values} file is a convenient file format to persist this kind of data because the values from different execution sessions can be easily appended using established schema.
The CSVWriter class introduces methods for appending the data to the file. The other helper methods allow for checking the correctness of the file and its content.
