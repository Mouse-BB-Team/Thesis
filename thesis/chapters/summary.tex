\section{Limitations, conditions and problems of the current study}
Although the model was considered with different set of parameters and various approaches, it did not perform well.
Due to certain limitations, some aspects of the model performance could not been improved.
Some problems can be addressed, that have a great impact of the overall results and are described in the following sections.

\subsection{Dataset limitation}
The main reason of poor performance has to be an insufficient dataset used in the study.
The searching for proper and publicly available data resulted in failure.
In other related works, like Chong et al. [1] (!!!TODO!!!! cite \"User Authentication Based on Mouse Dynamics Using Deep Neural Networks:
A Comprehensive Study\" and make bibliography work)(and possible cite also other work) or ...[2]... points at the Balabit Mouse Challenge Dataset as the most popular and comprehensive source data for mouse sequences and behaviors.
However, this dataset is not appropriate for the problem considered in this study.

The Balabit dataset consist of an user sessions recorded on the remote machine. The data includes a timing and position of the mouse cursor of ten different users.
Splited dataset represents training sessions and test sessions.

In the training sessions one can find $65$ legitimate sessions of various length, where in total gives $2253871$ rows of registered user mouse actions.\\
Test sessions consists of $2357714$ recorded actions, where during the session execution of the legal user, the illegitimate action happens – session is taken over by other user. Illegal sessions are the mix of two legitimate users, and when the model considers the example it should assume one user, that is then interrupted and replaced by another user somewhere betwen the session.

This data does not relates to the problem given in the scope of this work – the model that can distinguish legitimate human user and non-human bot behavior is taken into consideration. This particular case is a derived from the general problem of distinguishing two or more users and represents more specific case of using mouse behavioral biometrics.

Since no public dataset is available, there was an attempt to collect exclusive and dedicated data.
The custom environment [link to GH with Data-Collection module] created for the puropse of this study was designed to collect and record the mouse data, but it did not serve real responsiveness of commercial website, and therefore it may caused some confusion among the subject users. By that means, data collecting was in some kind suggestive and task-oriented. That factors could have an negative impact on the quality of collected data.

The other thing is that the participation in the study was completely voluntary and community based.
Advertisement of the ongoing study was posted on couple of Facebook groups and gathered about $65$ (check exactly how many) unique users. Overall user mouse actions collected is equal to $x=check$ rows.
Number of bot actions registered and collected is equal to $x=checkbot$ rows.\\
Such an uneven proportion of the data made the dataset imbalanced.

\subsection{Finance and time limitation}
Other problem encountered when preparing the thesis was the limit of the finance intended. Because the research was planned to reach many different users it has to be deployed and hosted on trusted and reliable resources – in this case it was the Google Cloud Platform$^{1przypis}$.

Google cloud services offers efficient deployment of the whole system.
Cloud services are really convenient way to handle such a project.
The computation and storage resources can be acquired on-demand, with no time and commitement. This form of hosting the application comes with its price.
The whole infrastructure was running for about two months, and due this time generated the cost of total 300\$.
This amount of cash is the highest financial outlay that could have been incurred by the authors of the work.

Longer exposure on the web would cost extra money, that could not been afforded. Additionally, there were existing concerns for scheduled milestones and goals. The project has been carefully thought out, and in order to meet the adopted deadlines, the data collection period also had to follow srict terms and deadlines.
