    abstract={This chapter presents an overview and classification of security approaches based on computer analysis of human behavior. Overview of different methodologies is followed by an analysis of achieved accuracy rates, required equipment and prospects for future improvements. In particular the following broad categories of behavior-based authentication mechanisms are examined: Behavioral Biometrics (Authorship based, Human--Computer Interaction based, Motor Skill, and Purely Behavioral), Behavioral Passwords (syntactic, semantic, one-time methods and visual memory based), Biosignals (cognitive and semi-controllable biometrics) and Virtual Biometrics (representations of users in virtual worlds).},

    abstract = {This work surveys biometric based authentication systems that deploy mouse movements. Typically, timing and movement direction, along with clicking actions are used to build a profile of a user, which is then used for authentication purposes. Most system relies on a continuous monitoring process, or require the user to interact with a program (such as a game) in order to derive sufficient statistical information regarding their mouse dynamics. In this work, a novel graphical authentication system dubbed Mouse-lock is presented. This system deploys the analogy of a safe, and the password is entered via the mouse in a graphical equivalent of combination lock. The question is whether this approach elicits sufficient discriminatory information from a relatively minimalist degree of interaction from the user. The preliminary results from a study with six subjects indicates, based on FAR/FRR values, that this is a viable approach.},

    abstract = {Most1 existing researches on identity authentication based on Mouse Dynamics require strictly restriction on experimental environment, and can only verify the legitimacy of the user without the ability to specifically recognize the identity of the impostor. To address this issue, we proposed an identification and authentication approach based on a weighted voting technology under an uncontrolled environment, which extracting both conventional statistical features and newly defined individual features of various operations. Two experiments are conducted with a dataset from 12 users. We obtained an accuracy of 84.1% in the identification experiment with an authentication time of 90s. In the authentication experiment, we get a FRR of 5.5% and a FAR of 8.8% with only 30s. Those noticeable results indicate the proposed method can be applied in practical environment.},

    abstract = {Web bots are automated scripts that perform online tasks like human. Abuse of bot technology poses various threats to the security of websites. Recently, mouse dynamics has been applied to bot detection by analyzing whether recorded mouse operations are consistent with human operational patterns. In this paper, we introduce a deep neural network approach to bot detection. We propose a new representation method for mouse movement data, which converts every mouse movement into an image containing its spatial and kinematic information. This representation method makes it possible to utilize CNN models to automate feature learning from mouse movement data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to detect 96.2{\%} of bots with statistical attack ability while traditional detection methods using hand-crafted features or RNN can only detect less than 30{\%} of them.},
